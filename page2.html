            Batman: Arkham City isn't perfect,<br>
            but listing the little things I didn't like gets in the way of all the stuff I adored. <br>
            The voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, <br>
            the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight -- <br>
            these are the things that standout looking back. <br>
            I've beaten this thing twice and still want to call in sick and chase Riddler Trophies.<br>
            Batman: Arkham City isn't just better than Batman: Arkham Asylum, <br>
            it's better than most games on the market.

        <h2>PC Gamer</h2>

        <p>
           The action is magicked straight from the films and comics,<br> 
           where discretion and detection are as important as slamming Bat-fists through the faces of the criminally insane.<br> 
           Well, almost as important. Batman in motion is awesome to behold: he sneaks and swoops with a deft mo-cap mastery, <br>
           and annihilates room after room of thuggish mental patients with fluid violence, <br>
           catching and deflecting blows in a storm of semi-procedural devastation.

           Rocksteady have done themselves proud with Batman: Arkham City. <br>
           Rather than simply revisiting old ground, <br>
           the British developer has upped the ante on its impressive last outing and delivered a game, <br>
           which stands head and shoulders over its previous efforts.<br> 
           Despite facing stiffer competition than its predecessor, <br>
           Batman: Arkham City is easily the best Batman video game of all time and <br>
           while it may be too soon to call it the best game released all year, <br>
           it's going to take something pretty special to top it.

        <h2>GameSpot</h2> 
        </div>    
        <p>
             From the speedy exhilaration of soaring high above the streets <br>
             to the atmospheric thrill of discovering long-forgotten secrets in the tunnels below Gotham, <br>
             this is an unforgettable adventure that will keep you coming back to the cape and cowl long after you've seen the credits roll.
        </p>
        <div class = "header2">
        <h2>Kotaku</h2> 
        </div>   
        <p>
             Dynamic, exciting, full of fun characters, <br>
             stuffed with things to do and built upon gameplay that is so good <br>
             that it shines even when the bait of plot development and ability-upgrading is removed, <br>
             Arkham City is a magnificent game that merely risks, as far as Batman games go, being untoppable.
